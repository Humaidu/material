Started again at 9sharp with a review of yesterday. Suggested we all start at for loops and go from there.

10:30 came back and said everyone move to if/else

Some people trying to copy from the internet, find tricks or whatever to get around applying algorithmic process to the problem. They haven't been taught this way before, so this definitely *isn't* just a matter of learning new syntax. We can improve on this next year. Maybe a day of solving problems like this on the board?

There are basically two constructs - if/then and loops. If we can have a list of fun problems to go through together where we can introduce algorithmic process to a class, then we can convert that to code more effectively. Problem is it's thursday now and we haven't yet finished python, and maybe we won't. Maybe the questions are too hard? Students don't seem to get the context - we're in the 'for loops' section but some don't seem to get the hint - so we should be more explicit to use a for loop to answer the following questions. But also many students simply aren't reading the questions.

I think next year we need to target students who have finished at least their second year. Filter heavily on students who have read and understood the questions in the application. Maybe show a random question to the student to answer?

Actually I think we could provide more skeleton code in sample answers so students write more and more as they progress.

Started git at 1:30 after lunch without the slides, talked about some of the problems we have as developers saving code on the filesystem, then introduced git init, add and commit. Straight back to labs to use git regularly when making changes.
