# ![IoT in Africa: Labs](../blob/master/assets/img/logo-128.png?raw=true)

Our teaching is supplemented by *lab work*. In fact - it's quite often the other way around -
you'll spend a lot more time coding than we will talking!

> *Note*
> This README file is written in `markdown`, a meta-language for documentation on the web.
> GitHub comes with a `markdown` *renderer*, which reads the source and converts it into
> HTML that you can view in a web browser. If your project includes a `README.md` file,
> GitHub will render it automatically.

That's it! Your first taste of GitHub. We'll spend a lot more time talking about git and GitHub soon.
