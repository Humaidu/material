Arrived at 9 prompt with a crowd outside the door, really reassuring. Rexford missing but the rest of the class here as hoped, plus three more. Two guys wanted to join but pushed them away, didn't seem fair in case more girls arrived. Maybe a bad decision.

Kicked off 9am with a recap of the first day - drew out the directory tree & ran over absolute and relative paths, cd, pwd, ls, etc.

10am came back to recap switches to ls - how -al means -a -l etc.

11am came back and introduced STDOUT as the "file" that the cat and ls commands write to, that just happens to mean the terminal. Grep with beginning and end anchors. Backticks for subshells. Then hinted at how we can change stdout with <>| etc.

Break for lunch at 12. Hoping to be done by the end of the afternoon. Mayyyyyybe not.

After lunch came back at 1 sharp with 7 people in the room. Drew "wc -l" on paper and had someone hold it. Talked about stdin and stdout, and also stderr for completeness. Then introduced "cat foo" and formalised that it reads from foo and writes to stdout. Then piped cat foo | wc -l.

Then of course the rest turned up. oh well.

some realisation of pipes and redirects, mayyyybe a quarter. Lots of people not reading the labs, just typing in commands. I wonder if that'd change if we admitted final year students only.

Situation improved by the end of the day, more pep-talks and riot-act readings and most people got the idea that they had to understand the work, not just copy & paste. That'll improve with the python labs, where you can't just paste code because we don't give it.

Most people towards the end by 15:30, really happy with that. Added two extra exercises on the board - what do >> and $$ mean. Fun, because they're difficult to google for.

Start tomorrow with more q&a. And I'll explain why we're doing pop quizzes, too.
