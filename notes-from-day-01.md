we'd asked people to be in the room at 8am sharp, mostly people rocked up between 9-10. But that's okay because it's a fairly soft start.

Introduced the course - a bit about programming, who wants to be a coder, what languages people know. What we're going to teach.

I was wearing t-shirt, shorts and sandals, which is weird for them because Ghana is a fairly cargo-cult conservative dress society (business men wear suits so I can't start a business without a suit). It's nice to make the point that this ain't your regular class.

We'd come in the night before and removed a bunch of kit. There were rows of three desks astride, each with three seats - so 9 to a row. It was pretty cramped. Josh and I removed the middle kit from each desk leaving a row of six with loads of room to play. The room was much lighter, loads more space. People have disliked coding, we think, partly because of the atmosphere in the room. Changing the layout of the space, wearing different clothes, not using the whiteboard, insisting on first names, swearing a little, is a nice way to break the mould. 

We'd installed Raspbian on each pi, and then unplugged them to allow the students to pick the thing up and point out to me what all the bits are.

Then we build the thing together - power last - and switch it on. The first *wow* moment of the course is when students realise the thing they plugged in is powering the whole thing. It was really incredible. 

Spend an hour (around 10am)
* making sure everyone can check their email
* browsing to this wiki for labs
* login.iotinafrica.com
* answering the question "what fun stuff can I install on my raspberry pi?" - then asking volunteers to stand up (again, breaking the norm) and tell the class what they found
* "What is the raspberry Pi ZERO? How is it different? Here, it's really nice to point out that we'd bought the kit in Kumasi - four hours drive NorthWest. Like, you can get this in Ghana? How much is it? The zero is five bucks - that's five bottles of beer.

Over the course of the morning some faculty joined us. I spent a bunch of time with Patience, Frank's secretary & our partner in crime, showing her the kit, explaining the changes we'd made to the room, showing her how much fun people were having. Asked for her help next year & in particular with girls. She committed to helping next year and then (total surprise) came back and said she'd rounded up more girls who would arrive tomorrow. So fingers crossed.
The HoD, Set, came over an I sat him down and had him build a Pi, just like the students had done. Sufficiently amazed, he asked me why they weren't using them for everything. ... I put him in touch with Isaac and he promised to come back.
Frank's wife Margaret joined us, she's an electrical engineer & was in her element.
Two guys from network operations joined us and didn't know their way around the terminal at all. Surprising/disappointing but maybe they'll stick with it. I'm not quite happy with the idea of free training to faculty but if they're not taking students seats we'll run with it.

* some discussion of Pi HATs - Hardware Attached on Top - that allow other sensors and components to be added to the Pi.
* Meanwhile we collected email addresses and added people to a new slack group we'd created

Then introduce the labs before lunch, around 11am

Most people around adduser/userdel by lunchtime.

lunch 12.30-1.30
q&a after lunch. started again at 1.30 sharp because I want latecomers to know we start on time. What does sudo do, why is it important. What's mkdir? Leads to a brief discussion of the filesystem and a forward pointer for this afternoon.

first to get to the linux lab was at 14:45

One guy had run so far ahead he'd got to the end of the lab without understanding any of it. Like, he'd just typed in all the commands without reflection and then moved to the next, as though it was an exercise in typing. Read him the riot act (day 1!) and he buckled down and started again. It's the summer holidays dude, go play!

on reflection:
* great idea to install raspbian
* great idea to have students build the pi themselves, it led to a really great moment of clarity & ownership
* fun to give the students time to setup their own environment. change menus, colours, set the background etc
* most people at roughly the same stage by 14:45 - installing. This can be done in parallel with figuring out sudo etc.

then finish labs until 4

I expect tomorrow to be working on linux labs until into the afternoon.

Some more girls are being introduced tomorrow, so I'll ask the more advanced boys to make room & help them get up to speed.

Ended today with Q&A, so do the same first thing (9am sharp) tomorrow and then we'll run through the start of the linux labs together. Maybe do the end halfway through the afternoon.

I've asked Josh to prep to teach Python intro on Wednesday.
