## Introduction

The aim of this course is to introduce Python 2.7 as a modern, scalable, dynamic programming language with applicability on small but powerful hardware such as the Raspberry Pi.

We re-introduce core programming concepts such as typing, flow control, and modularity using the python syntax as a vehicle for learning. Concepts are taught and then reinforced with open-ended labwork, designed to be completed in pairs.

## Length
The taught section of the course should take around an hour, with another two hours for lab work.

## Learning aims
After completion of this course, the student should know and understand:
* The basics of the Python built-in type system
* Control flow using conditionals and iteration
* Some idiomatic python (e.g., if-in-expression)
* The use of functions to encourage code reuse
* The use of the underlying filesystem to encourage modularity

## Further work
The accompanying course "advanced Python" should be taught shortly afterwards, in order to encourage knowledge retention and grow the students understanding of these underlying topics.
