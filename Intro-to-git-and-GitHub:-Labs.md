## 1: Create a GitHub profile

The first thing we want you to do is create your own GitHub profile. If you already have one, you can skip
this step - go right ahead & fork the iotinafrica/intro-to-iotinafrica project in the [next section](#2)!

* Browse to [github.com](github.com) and sign up for an account. Fill out the form, and you're done!
* You might want to upload a picture, too. Find one you like, or take one on your phone and email it to yourself, then upload it to github.
* Find some software projects hosted on github that you've used in the past and *star* them.
* Go to the `iotinafrica` repository in github and *star* it :)

## 2: Investigate github!

1. Find a project that you know about: Look at it's *code*, *issues*, and *pull requests*
1. Find a project that you like and fork it. Clone it into your local repo! 

## 3: Upload your own code!
Create a file called `readme.md` in your HelloWorld directory
1. Add some text which describes what the project does
1. Commit your change, then push to `origin`.
1. Refresh the HelloWorld project page in your github account. What's different?
1. Read about [MarkDown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and improve your readme!

## 4: Git questions.
* Make a change to a local file and stage it. What does `git diff` show?
* What does `git status -s` do?

## 3: (Stretch)
1. Look at the `issues` page for a project you like. Find a bug that needs to be fixed and have a go!
