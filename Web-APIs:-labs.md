# ![Web APIs: Labs](../blob/master/assets/img/logo-128.png?raw=true)

Welcome to the Web APIs lab! This lab is pretty open-ended because we want to see what APIs you can discover and use. You can work in pairs or larger groups. Here's a bunch of things you might want to try. Choose one and make it awesome - or come up with your own idea :)

Don't forget to create a GitHub repo for your project, and check in regularly!

## Exercises

### Weatherbot!
* Create a twitter bot using [tweepy](http://www.tweepy.org/)
* Every hour, it should check and tweet the weather using emojis

### Distancebot!
* Use [GeoPy](https://github.com/geopy/geopy) to build an app which takes any two cities and calculates the distance between them.

### Rock on!
* Use the [LastFM API](http://www.last.fm/api) to tell a person about their favourite artist.

### What's going on?
* Use the [News API](https://newsapi.org/#documentation) to build a news app.

### Country data
* Use the [World Bank API](https://wbdata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to find out how much money different countries spend on, say, university students ;-)

### Cheer up!
* Use the [tweety](http://www.tweepy.org/) API and the [FacePlusPlus](https://market.mashape.com/faceplusplus/faceplusplus-face-detection) face detection API to check a user's profile picture and tell them to cheer up if they're not smiling üëç 

## Roll your own:

For the rest of the day, we want you to work in small groups 
(maybe double up your pairs) to build an application that does something interesting using the programmable
web.

Look at the APIs available on [MashApe](https://market.mashape.com/explore) to help you get started.

If you want to send an SMS, create an account on [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com) and let me know your email address.

Don't rush - spend some time looking at the options available to you. You might need to sign up for a
free or trial account, that's cool.

Try to choose something that's personally interesting to your group, because that way you'll stay motivated.

Make sure you use your knowledge of git and python modules, so you can split up the project into tasks and all
work at once.
