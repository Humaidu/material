## Introduction
The aim of this module is to:
* Introduce the student to the web as a runtime environment
* Show the use of python in a 'real-world' scenario
* Discuss UI and UX as first-class concerns

## Length

The taught section of the module is split into three short sections, each taking around fifteen minutes.

After each taught section is a pair-programming hacking session, which is designed to take around one hour.

In total, the Advanced Python course is appropriate for an open-ended morning. The afternoon could be used to
introduce topics such as Flasks parent/child templating, form input handling with POST requests, or more styling with CSS3.

## Learning aims
After completion of this course, the student should know and understand:
* The client/server model for web application
* The nature of browser rendering of simple content
* Styling for the web with Bootstrap

## Prerequisites
The student should have completed the Intro to Python course. The Intro to Web APIs course introduces HTTP GET, so should be delivered before this. The students should have had some exposure to HTML and CSS in the past; this is outside the scope of our programme.

## Further work
This course sets the foundations for working with databases, platforms, building REST APIs, and building dashboards for existing services.
