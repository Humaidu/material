## Introduction

The aim of this module is to introduce students to the "programmable web": the use of distributed
web services to perform computation or to gather intelligence about the world. Examples include
geolocation, distributed calculation and machine learning, search, and home automation.

## Length
The taught section of this course introduces theory only; as such it should take maybe 45 minutes.

The exploratory section is lightly-structured to encourage students to discover APIs themselves and build their own
projects. We introduce some project ideas and expect students to work in pairs or small groups to build a useful 
solution that they will then present to other students.

## Learning aims
After completion of this course, the student should know and understand:
* The themes and concepts behind Web APIs and the programmable web
* Structured data using JSON
* The basics of RESTful APIs and their pythonic equivalents or wrappers
* How to discover web services using aggregation sites

## Prerequisites
The student should have a familiarity with the Python language.
