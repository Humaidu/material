Project plans:

1. An MQTT system to take inputs from a number of distributed sensors and display them on an LCD screen
2. A security system that will alert you when someone is at your door, by flashing a light if you're home or emailing you if you're away. The system uses a PIR to detect if you're home.
3. A device to allow a pregnant lady to press a button when she goes into labour. A light on the device flashes when help is coming.
4. A traffic lights system that lets more cars through when the lane is busy.
5. A button on a restaurant table that alerts a waiter, by way of a message on an LCD screen, when attention is required.
