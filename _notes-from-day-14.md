This is our last day of programming, before graduation tomorrow morning. Trying to raise spirits as students realise they haven't done nearly enough work! Also most of the projects are of the form "receive input" -> "message over mqtt" -> "output to LCD or IFTTT or flashing light", which of course is fine as long as you have a reasonable narrative.

Next year we'll need some web topics at least or we'll all be doing exactly the same project. RPI isn't great for this stuff. Maybe some simple robotics? I'm not sure bigger teams would work well, it's hard enough splitting up the work as it is. 

Important things to note for next year:
* It's important to divide the work. Having three people trying to solve the same problem won't scale.
* If you run into trouble try to solve it. Then try again. Then ASK. Don't sit on problems
* Important for the teacher to bring in enough kit so we're not ferrying stuff around.
* All problems can be solved on the last day; the projects are pretty simple so there are no emergencies. A sense of urgency is useful, though. As is the threat of not graduating.

We need to move away from learned helplessness. "Sam, it's not downloading!"

Things we need to cover from the beginning:
* basic control flow. if/else, loops, functions. 
* ...
* actually that's it
