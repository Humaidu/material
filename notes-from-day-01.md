we'd asked people to be in the room at 8am sharp, mostly people rocked up between 9-10. But that's okay because it's a fairly soft start.

Introduced the course - a bit about programming, who wants to be a coder, what languages people know. What we're going to teach.

We'd come in the night before and installed Raspbian on each pi, and then unplugged them to allow the students to pick the thing up and point out to me what all the bits are.

Then we build the thing together - power last - and switch it on. The first *wow* moment of the course is when students realise the thing they plugged in is powering the whole thing.

Spend an hour (around 10am)
* making sure everyone can check their email
* browsing to this wiki for labs
* login.iotinafrica.com
* answering the question "what fun stuff can I install on my raspberry pi?"
* "What is the raspberry Pi ZERO? How is it different?

* some discussion of Pi HATs - Hardware Attached on Top - that allow other sensors and components to be added to the Pi.
* Meanwhile we collected email addresses and added people to a new slack group we'd created

Then introduce the labs before lunch, around 11am

Most people around adduser/userdel by lunchtime.

lunch 12.30-1.30
q&a after lunch. started again at 1.30 sharp because I want latecomers to know we start on time. What does sudo do, why is it important. What's mkdir? Leads to a brief discussion of the filesystem and a forward pointer for this afternoon.
then finish labs until 4
