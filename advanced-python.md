## Introduction
The aim of this module is twofold:
* To expand the students knowledge of the Python 2.7 programming language
* To introduce the student to advanced programming techniques such as generics,
recursion, and functional programming

## Length

The taught section of the module is split into two sections, taking 45 minutes to an hour each.

After each taught section is a pair-programming lab which is designed to take around two hours.

In total, the Advanced Python course is appropriate for a long afternoon extending into the evening.

## Learning aims
After completion of this course, the student should know and understand:
* Objects, classes and inheritance in Python
* The underlying 'object-as-dictionary' model
* Functional aspects of Python
* ...

## Prerequisites
The student should have completed the Intro to Python course, or similar.

## Further work
At this stage, we encourage students to consider contributions to an existing open-source project.
