Another solid day of work, some teams finishing up. Need to work harder on scope. Four days is a tough sell!

Next year we'll need to figure out how to package up these projects for transport. Get the teams to take a photo of their setup just in case. And 30 desks on site at Accra (?) for a tech fair. Plenty of room? Aaaand food. Get-in around 11-12, lunch @1, graduation @2 then tech fair.
