# ![Introduction to Linux: Labs](../blob/master/assets/img/logo-128.png?raw=true)

Welcome to the Introduction to Linux lab!

This time, we're going to discover how to use terminal commands to get work done. Let's get started!

## Prep
Hit the keys `ctrl`+`alt`+`t` to open a terminal. You could hit the icon at the top of the screen, but using the keyboard is quicker and easier.

## Simple commands
Firstly, we're going to discover the `man` command. `man` shows a _manual_ page for a certain topic. Type `man pwd` `<enter>` to see what the `pwd` command does. Use the ⬆️  and ⬇️  keys to scroll around the page, or hit the spacebar to skip a whole page.

Once you've found out what `pwd` does, hit `q` to exit the man system. Now, type `pwd` again: what does the output tell you?

Type `cd \` `<enter>`, then try `pwd` again.
* What happened? What does `cd` do? (hint: there's no 'man page' because `cd` is so simple!)
* Use `cd` to go back to the directory you were in. This is your _home_ directory - it's where all your stuff goes. You can always get back here by typing `cd ~`.
* type `cd ..`, then check where you are with `pwd`. What does `..` mean? (hint: it's in *every* folder!)

Type `ls`.
* What does `ls` do?
* Type `ls -a`. Read the manpage to find out what the _a_ switch does. What's the difference between `ls` and `ls -a`?
* _Without_ using `cd`, show all the files and directories in the root directory (remember "/"?)
* _Without_ using `cd`, show all the files and directories in the parent directory (remember ".."?)
* What do the switches `l`, `r`, and `t` do? What does the command `ls -lart` do? Why is it useful?

What does `ps` do? Try it!

## Editing text
Open the `pico` editor.

Type some text! Say hello, write your name, where you come from, what you like to do in your spare time. Write two paragraphs about yourself.
* At the bottom of the screen, you'll see all the commands you can use. Sometimes you'll see `^` - this just means `ctrl`. So for example, `^O` just means `ctrl`+`o`.
* Use the _WriteOut_ command to save your work (name the file with your first name), then the _Exit_ command to quit pico. You'll be right back at the command prompt.
* My file is called `sam`. What happens when I type `cat sam` in the command prompt? Try that with the name of your file. Use the manpage for cat to figure out what's happening.
* What happens when I type `less sam`? What's `less`? (Type `q` to escape!). Do you recognise `less`? It's how manpages are shown on the screen!
* What happens when I type `head -1 sam`? What about `tail -1 sam`?

## Advanced commands
* `whoami` prints out your user ID!
* `ps aux` prints details of every process running on your machine.
* `grep` searches the input for lines matching a certain pattern. For example, `grep cheese sam` prints out all the lines in the file called _sam_ that contain the exact word "cheese".
* Grep is very powerful. `grep ^I sam` prints out all the lines in the file _sam_ that _start with_ the character "I".
* What do you think `grep UK$ sam` does?
* You can use the backticks (\`) to execute a command and pass its output to the outer command. This sounds complex but it's really simple. If I type `grep \`whoami\` sam`, the `whoami` command is executed first. That returns "sam". That output is then substituted into the command, so `grep sam sam` is executed. See? Easy!

## Combining commands
Some commands can be combined together. For example, `wc` is a simple command that shows a wordcount for a file - the number of characters, lines, and words in the file.
* Type `wc` `<enter>`. Then, type a bunch of text. You're actually writing a file into wc right now! Hit enter and enter some more text. Do it some more. When you're done, hit `ctrl`+`d` to end the "file". What do the three numbers mean?
* What does `wc -l` do? Enter it as a command and then do the same - what does the one number mean?
* Remember my file called `sam`? What happens when I enter `cat sam | wc -l`? What is the "pipe" doing?
* Try it with your file. How many words are in your file? How many lines of text?
* Use `ls` and `wc` to find out how many files and directories are in your `root` directory.
* How many files and directories are in your `home` directory?
* Enter `ls > files`. Then enter `cat files`. What happened? What is `files`? What does `>` do?
* Enter `wc -l < files`. What does the number mean?
* `tee` is very useful. Before passing its input through to its output, it also writes the input to a file. 

## Building pipelines
Linux commands are based on the philosophy of doing one job, and combining simple tasks into complex operations using `|`, `<`, and `>`.

The good thing about building pipelines is that you can build all the bits separately, and then combine them at the end. Let's work through one together: save a list of all the running process that are owned by me.
* Firstly, what command do we use to print out all the running processes? What does the output mean?
* Next, how can I find out the ID of the current user?
* Next, how can I filter the output of the processes command?
* Great! Now let's combine all those.
  * Firstly, list the processes.
  * Pass the output of that to our filter command. This should also get the current userid.
  * Finally, output the results of the filter to a file. 

Work in groups to build pipelines to do the following:
* Write a file called _everything_ which contains all the files and directories in your home directory, *and* a file called _directories_ which contains just the directories.
  * HINT: You'll need to understand the output of `ls -la`.
  * HINT: You'll need to use a `grep` pattern
  * HINT: You'll need to use `tee` once.

* Find out what `watch -n1 "ls -lart /"` does. Try it out - then it `ctrl`+`c` to exit. Write a similar pipeline to show the _one_ most recently edited file in your home directory every second. Open another terminal window and use the `echo` and `>` command to create a new file, and check that your pipeline's output changed.
