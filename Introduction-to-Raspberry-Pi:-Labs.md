# ![Intro to Python: Labs](../blob/master/assets/img/logo-128.png?raw=true)

Welcome to the Raspberry Pi lab!

Work through this lab on your own or with friends. We'll do the first few topics together, then you're free to have a play around on your own!

## Set up your Raspberry Pi
Push the SD card firmly into your Raspberry Pi. Plug the Keyboard and Mouse into the USB ports on the side, and plug in the screen using the HDMI cable that comes with it.

Finally, using the cable that comes with your Pi, plug it in! Check you can see the green light on the board, and you should see the Raspberry Pi logo on the screen.
