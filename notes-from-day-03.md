Started again at 9sharp with rehash of days 1&2, went fairly well. Then immediately josh introduced the python REPL and we went ahead with the first lab session.
Came together at 10 and went over the first few exercises, pointing out int/float division and + overloading etc. Told about the import math and gave 20 minutes to finish off.

Came back at 10:20 and did 50 minutes of slides until Functions. Turns out this is too long, but functions is the next section of the lab. Need to reorder that so we can teach/lab in lockstep. Also there's a bug in the tuple slide.

11:10 means 50 mins of labs until lunch, then we'll carry on through the afternoon before git, possibly at eod, more likely tomorrow. This might be a bit much to deal with today. Try to make it fun this afternoon?

A lot of the class don't know how to code. Need to be more stringent next year. Final year students only, must know at least one programming language?

Straight back into the labs at 1 sharp, with a bit of class hand-holding through the functions labs.

15:30 and some people have got as far as for loops. I've told the class they can install python on their own laptops, but I think we're going to have to move on at lunchtime tomorrow. Git & Github in the afternoon, maybe then we can finish off with Python labs?
